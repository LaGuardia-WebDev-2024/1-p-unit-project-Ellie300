        <h4>History</h4>
      <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.
Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene, over 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, prior to the development of agriculture.
The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans. </p>
